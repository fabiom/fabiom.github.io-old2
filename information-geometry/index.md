### Books
- Amari, Nagoka --- [Methods of Information Geometry](https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Methods_of_Information_Geometry.html?id=vc2FWSo7wLUC) _(classic reference; best choice for a first reading; explains most of the basic ideas and the geometry needed; great focus on the dual connections)_
- Calin, Udrişte --- [Geometric Modeling in Probability and Statistics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319077789) _(connects to information theory; full of examples; is divided in two parts: one about statistical models, and the other about abstract statistical manifolds)_
- Ay, Jost, Lê, Schwachhöfer --- [Information Geometry](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-56478-4) _(modern reference; definetely the most most geometric abstract one; shows many possible generalizations)_
- Amari --- [Information Geometry and Its Applications](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-4-431-55978-8) _(provides a overview of many applications of information geometry to different fields)_
